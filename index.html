    <h1>OVERVIEW</h1>
    <p>3DR values the benefits of open source software development for us as a company, developers, and the broader community of users. Our developers include academics, small businesses, large businesses, and individual contributors. We strive to put powerful tools in the hands of these developers for three simple reasons: to increase the value of the platform, to establish trust between our engineers and the development community, and to reuse what has already been done so that we can all work on new and challenging problems.</p>

    <h1>Why does 3DR use Open Source Software?</h1>
    <p>Open source software (OSS) is a software development model that underpins many 3DR products and most of the technology products in our everyday lives. At 3DR, we choose to develop and use OSS for the following reasons:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Culture: We are fundamentally invested in sharing.</li>
      <li>Trust: We believe in the tight bond of trust OSS engenders between the company, our developers, and the broader community of users.</li>
      <li>Quality: We benefit from a community of developers who will test the software we build.</li>
      <li>History: History has proven that open standards win (eg. HTML, WebKit, USB, Wifi).</li>
      <li>Reuse: Lets not reinvent the wheel!</li>
      <li>Recruiting: Smart people attract other smart people.</li>
      <li>Portability (No Lock-in): Developers want to know that the tools and applications they make are not tied solely to the success of a particular company.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1> What we tend to open</h1>
    <p>As a rule of thumb, we will open source, under various licenses, the following types of software:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Generic tools: A tool, library, or other utility that solves a generic problem </li>
      <li>Non-core: Software not part of our core value proposition as a business</li>
      <li>Discretionary: Code that we collectively decide provides greater value to our community of developers than the incremental value it may provide to 3DR if keep proprietary</li>
      <li>Derived work: As it is often faster to develop using open tools, we correspondingly open derived works based on those tools in adherence with the license terms and conventions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>How We Do it</h1>
    <p>We believe in putting powerful tools in the hands of developers.  In many cases, this means open sourcing what we are working on early and often in accordance with our policy and core values!  When contributing to other open source projects we strive to follow best practices and licenses set by that open source community.</p>

    <h1>How we develop</h1>
    <p>In general, we are biased towards developing in an open fashion to the ends of finding bugs early, driving platform adoption, and increasing developer goodwill. 3DR protects future product releases until they are public. We practice modular (not monolithic) software development so that software not-directly related to future products can be considered for open sourcing based on the metrics above.</p>
